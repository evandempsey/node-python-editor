==================

Node.js demo of a browser-based Python editor

The application demonstrates how to use RabbitMQ to connect a Node server with a Python worker using amqplib and pika. 

The Python worker simply runs the provided code with exec, with no attempt to prevent dangerous activity. It is a demonstration, and not intended to be used in environments where users could input untrusted code.
